ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks [Link](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf)

This landmark CNN project employed a 60-million-parameter network featuring five convolutional layers to perform image classification. Key to its success was the optimized GPU implementation of the convolution operation. A regularization technique, dropout, is also introduced.
